    "\n",
    "In this study, we will be analyzing tweets from twitter to help present findings on sentiment towards product related to Android, Apple, and Google. Many companies want to keep track of public sentiment about various products. Positive sentiment might drive production for creators or inventory management for retailers. It might drive the attention of influencers, news organizations, and consumers. Twitter is a platform where individuals and companies express themselves and have conversations and is full of information about how people feel about particular products.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## I. Business Understanding\n",
    "The goals of the business problem will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyze tweets from twitter to gain insight of sentiment towards various products. \n",
    "2. Determine which features of tweets best show as the best predict if tweets can be categorized as positive, negative, or neither. \n",
    "3. Maximize positive sentiment for products from the following companies. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Questions to consider:\n",
    "1. Do customers have positive or negative sentiment towards Apple, Android, or Google products?\n",
    "2. Which products might retailers want to keep in their stores to maxmize profit in inventory management?\n",
    "3. Which products might influencers want to highlight in their posts to gain the most attraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem with sentiment\n",
    "Emotions are also relative. Consdier the phrase, \"iPhones are better than Android phones.\" Is this a positive or a negative tweet? It depends! For this reason purposeful data preprocessing will be essential to building data categorization before training it on the model itself. There is a LOT of cleaning that needs to occur, with tweets containing many various symbols and characters that will distract the model from providing an accurate prediction. \n",

    "\n",
    "Our base data, which is the Brands and Product Emotions dataset, comes with three columns with categorical values, with every row being a separate tweet. The first column contains the text of the tweet. This text is copied striahgt from the original source, so it contains all the little unique things that tweets such as '@' mentions and '#' hashtags. The second column contains the target of the tweet. The target can be subjects such as 'iPad', 'iPhone', or 'Google' to name a few, and they denote what their respective tweet's subject is. For example, if the tweet target is 'Android App', we can assume that the tweet text in the same row has something to do with it. The last column contains the tweet sentiment, or the type of emotion the tweet text is showing. There are three possible values: positive, negative, and no emotion. A positive value would symbolize that the tweet has a positive feeling towards their listed target, while the opposite would be true if it was negative. A value of no emotion would mean that the tweet does not have a particularily strong feeling towards either side. As the tweet sentiment is the value that we are trying to predict, this will be our target column in our predictive models.\n"
